# Appendix: The Public Service Motivation Construct and Scale

The following is a brief overview of the Public Service Motivation scale and construct as developed by @perry1996. Perry defines Public Service Motivation (PSM), "as an individual's predisposition to respond to motives grounded primarily or uniquely in public institutions" [-@perry1996, 6]. An interesting aspect of the PSM construct and scale is that it is predicated on a particular understanding of motivation rooted in evolutionary psychology, and is also found elsewhere in social psychology literature [For review, see @higgins2021, 88]. Here and in other related work, motives are driven by needs. In particular, certain "drive theories" of motivation suggest that humans recognize something as a 'need' when its deprivation threatens our survival, our growth, or our ultimate life satisfaction and well-being. The motivation to fulfill unmet 'needs' may guide our behavior, impact on our thoughts, explain our selective attention and memory [@gardner2000; @hull1943; @mcleod2022]. As it relates to PSM, @perry1996 recognized three analytically distinct motivational categories: rational, norm-based, and affective.

> "Rational motives involve actions grounded in individual utility maximization. Norm-based motives refer to actions generated by efforts to conform to norms. Affective motives refer to those triggers of behavior that are grounded in emotional responses to various social contexts." [@perry1996, 6]

The PSM scale development was based on conceptual dimensions which were categorized into the motivational categories. The final PSM scale was confirmed as having four component dimensions: attraction to public policy making, commitment to the public interest, compassion, and self-sacrifice. However, the initial analysis of the finalized PSM scale demonstrated no distinct difference in model fit between a three and four dimensional PSM model. The public interest and self-sacrifice component dimensions were highly correlated, and so a comparison between the three and four-dimensional model was done. The four dimensional model showed a slighter higher $ùõò^2$ statistic, thus @perry1996 opted to retain the self-sacrifice dimension to maintain the four dimensional model of the PSM scale because, "it has had a historical connection to how we think about public service that is explicitly preserved by retaining the dimension." [@perry1996, 20]. However, it is recommended by Perry that further refinements to the PSM construct and scale be undertaken by future research.

The four component dimensions of the Public Service Motivation scale are described below;

Attraction to public policy making (rational motive)

:   Refers to a rational motive in which the opportunity to participation in the formation of public policy draws individuals to public service

Commitment to the public interest (norm-based)

:   An altruistic desire to serve the public interest

Compassion (aka "patriotism of benevolence", affective)

:   An affective state that combines the love of regime values and the love of others which drives people to exemplify "a patriotism of benevolence"[^22]

Self-sacrifice (unclear motive)

:   Refers to the willingness to substitute service to others for tangible personal rewards. In other words, the willingness of public servants to forego financial rewards for the intangible rewards received from serving the public.

After refinements were made to the initial scale, the resulting Public Service Motivation Scale was finalized to include 24-items measuring four component dimensions. The PSM measurement items are measured with Likert type response options. The items are listed in the table below
